jodo shinshu ( shin-buddhism / true pure land sect ) is one of the sects of japanese buddhism , and a religious community that shinran , an apprentice of honen , succeeded and which developed honen 's doctrine ( jodo shu / pure land buddhism ) in the early kamakura period .
due to the historical background of the origin of the sect name , most sects belonging to this religion call themselves shinshu as a sect name .
it used to also be called ikko shu and monto shu .
doctrine
by saying a prayer ( shomyo nenbutsu ) to the buddha ( namu amida butsu , namo amida butsu by hongan-ji school ) , practitioners can believe in the mercy of amida nyorai ( hereinafter called " nyorai " ) , and trust in tariki ( buddha 's power ) , which makes everyone , including the bad , go to jodo ( pure land ) after death and become buddha .
through this , the doctrine of shinshu is called " shinjin shoin , shomyo ho-on " ( faith makes it happen , and praying is for gratitude ) .
rennyo , the 8th head-priest of hongan-ji temple , stated in " ofumi " as follows .
" first of all , the policy of kaisan sho 'nin ( shinran ) gives faith first priority .
what use is faith us , shameless unenlightened men , who do wrong without good deed , to easily go to jodo of mida ( amida ) .
without acquiring this faith , no one could go to paradise and avoid falling to muken jigoku ( avici hell ) .
regarding " shomyo ho-on , " he mentioned " on that basis , we should be aware that shomyo nenbutsu is buddhist invocation to appreciate the kindness ( go-on hojin ) that nyorai decided that we could go to heaven . " ( ib. book5 , chapter10 ) , which means that shomyo nenbutsu in jodo shinshu are words of gratitude for nyorai 's salvation .
this is based on forty-eight vows of " infinite life sutra ( bussetsu muryojukyo ) " , especially the eighteenth vow ( senjaku hongan ) called " o 'hongan ) .
the principal image ( honzon ) is only amida nyorai .
however , takada school and a part of the sect have amida nyorai , kanzeon bosatsu and seishi bosatsu as their principal images , in zenko-ji amida sanson style .
generally , the idea that " the vow of amida nyorai is offered to us even at this moment and we are saved " ( gensho shojoju ) was misunderstood by a number of people , and repeatedly corrected .
rennyo mentioned in " ofumi ( gobunsho ) " ;
" not forgetting the kindness of mida , who decided that we could go to heaven long time ago , when achieving enlightenment is what faith is about .
this is a big misconception .
even though we know the story of mida nyorai 's achieving enlightenment , it does not mean anything if we do not know the story of faith in tariki that we can go to heaven . "
he explained here that knowing how nyorai became buddha is merely knowledge , and it is important to know the origin of faith in tariki given by nyorai ( faith in truth ) .
he confirmed shinjin shoin here and defined correctly , and never mentioned " reciting nenbutsu simply takes everyone to paradise " .
in jodo shinshu , faith given by nyorai helps people .
nenbutsu is definitely recited for gratitude , not the condition of going to heaven .
shinran also mentioned " what gets you to nehan ( nirvana ) is only faith " in " kyogo shinsho " , and " regard that true faith gets you to anoku bodai ( ultimate enlightenment ) " in " songo shinzo meimon " .
what makes shinshu greatly different from other buddhist sects is that monks have no commandments and are allowed to eat meat and to get married ( nikujiki-saitai ) . ( shinshu was the only sect that allowed monks to get married until the meiji period . )
originally , shinran learned that helping those who cannot help but stray from the concept of a general monk ( who enters the priesthood and practices asceticism , renouncing the world ) and the norm of buddhists ( laity ) living in the world is hongan nenbutsu ( praying for the vows ) from his master honen , and became the first monk to openly get married and have a child .
therefore , shinshu has two lineages , which are homyaku ( master -apprentice relationship ) and kechimyaku ( blood relationship ) .
and the given name is called homyo instead of kaimyo .
with its doctrine that everyone can go to heaven ( ojo jobutsu ) only by trusting nyorai 's power ( in other words , if acquiring true faith ) , shinshu , compared to other sects , is free from many religious exercises and customs , and makes much of nenbutsu and mombo ( learning the teachings of buddha ) for ho-on shatoku ( gratitude for kindness and virtue ) .
it is the only buddhist sect that doesn 't perform kaji kito ( incantation ) , which is another major feature of shinshu .
since it values rationality and has simple manners and teachings , it was widely accepted among the public in early modern ages , but on the other hand , it provoked antipathy from other sects and often got ridicule such as " monto ( shinshu followers ) know nothing " .
shinshu also encouraged each household to enshrine its honzon ( myogo honzon of " namu amida butsu " , or a picture or statue of amida nyorai ) .
the " rules " on shogon ( decoration ) of the buddhist altar for enshrinement are more strict than other sects .
shogon imitates honzan ( the head temple ) , which makes each sect of shinshu have different style and different ritual articles .
a honzon enshrined and decorated in the buddhist altar is called " onaibutsu " in shinshu .
shinshu doesn 't use this as a family altar or prayer altar .
the honzan of each shinshu sect basically has a goei-do hall to enshrine a portrait of shinran , the founder , as well as a main hall ( amida-do hall ) to enshrine amida nyorai , the honzon .
additionally , the architecture of shinshu temples has unique features rarely seen in other sects , such as wider gejin ( nave ) compared to naijin ( chancel ) .
each sect holds a memorial service called " ho-onko " on the anniversary of the death of the founder shinran sho 'nin .
this memorial service is held to give thanks for the blessing of gudo and gukyo ( seeking and promoting the teachings ) , and the blessing of amida nyorai acquired through them , and to recognize the teachings .
this is the biggest event in a year .
however , the day of the memorial service depends on each sect of shinshu .
( see the schedule of goshoki ho-onko by sect for details . )
the legitimate scriptures are jodo sanbukyo ( three pure land sutras ) .
the works of shichi koso ( seven high priests ) are also highly respected , although they are not scriptures .
" muryojukyo ubadaisha ganshoge " by tenjin was especially esteemed along with jodo sanbukyo by his master honen , who called these " sankyo ichiron " ( three sutras and one book ) .
shinran especially esteemed " bussetsu muryojukyo " and called it " daimuryojukyo " or " daikyo " .

though " ofumi ( gobunsho ) " by rennyo is respected along with the legitimate scriptures by hongan-ji school and otani school , it is not used by some sects such as takada school .
( since rennyo had kechimyaku from hongan-ji temple , the sects who value homyaku from the founder shinran do not use his work .
hongan-ji school of rennyo and takada school have a history of fight and conflict . )
the founder shinran took the lineage of tariki nenbutsu to shakamuni and shichi koso into consideration , and devoted himself to succeed " the teachings of jodo shu as the true religion " and to enhance it , through his life after he regarded honen ( the founder of jodo shu ) as his master .
different interpretations of hongan and nenbutsu by the apprentices after honen 's death made seizan and other schools of jodo shu criticize shinran .
shinran mentioned that " my master genku ( honen ) appeared by chie ko ( the power of amida nyorai ) , started jodo shinshu and stated senjaku hongan " in " koso wasan " written during his life , which shows he thought that jodo shinshu consisted of the teachings of jodo shinshu started by honen and carried on by himself .
whereas , rennyo 's thoughts were ;
" soshi sho 'nin ( shinran ) already established jodo shinshu - it has superior significance to jodo shu and he added the letter shin ( true ) and named it jodo shinshu . "
this shows that the view of the name of jodo shinshu , has changed with the times .
since shinran ( jogen no honan ) , engaged in his missionary work mainly in the kanto region ; after deportation to echigo , monto followers who got the teachings of shinran built up in kanto region .
after shinran died , it was formed as an independent religion from jodo shu .
though the successors of the teachings of shinran had the feeling that their own doctrine was the true teaching for going to jodo , they named themselves just shinshu at that time because naming themselves jodo shinshu could be interpreted as denial of jodo shu .
in fact , jodo shu and ji shu also called themselves " jodo shinshu " or " shinshu " once , and kyu ikko-ha of ji shu ( the founder : shunsho ikko ) was called " ikko shu " once .
in the early modern era , the edo shogunate prohibited them from naming themselves " jodo shinshu " under pressure from jodo shu , which made them call themselves " ikko shu " officially ( on the other hand , the lineage of shunsho ikko which originally called themselves " ikko shu " was forced to be integrated into ji shu which was originally unrelated ) .
the conflict between jodo shinshu and jodo shu over the question whether or not the shinran lineages could name themselves " jodo shinshu " was called shumei ronso , which lasted for 15 years from 1774 .
in 1872 , dajokan seiin issued an edict to each prefecture , saying " the name of ikko shu can be changed to shinshu , " and finally here in the modern ages , describing it as " ( jodo ) shinshu " was allowed .
history
the days of shinran
after shinran died , his great-grandson kakunyo ( 1270-1351 ) alleged the legitimacy of succession of shinran 's grave on the grounds of sandai-denji ( tradition of three generation ) and so on , and built hongan-ji temple ( also known as otani hongan-ji temple ) and called himself the third head-priest of hongan-ji temple .
against his movement , ryogen ( 1295-1336 ) , the seventh head-priest of bukko-ji temple , who succeeded the lineage of shinran 's disciples in kanto region , and other homyaku gradually took an opposing stance against hongan-ji temple , having bukko-ji temple and senju-ji temple as their bases .
jodo shinshu in those days had active missionary work in bukko-ji temple and senju-ji temple and acquired a number of followers , but hongan-ji temple just existed as a branch temple of tendai shu before the 8th head-priest rennyo .
from emergence of rennyo to ishiyama hongan-ji war
rennyo ( 1415-1499 ) , the 8th head-priest of hongan-ji temple , who emerged in the late muromachi period , established an organization called kou against the backdrop of the growth of the public at the time , provided the opportunity for people to learn the teachings equally and to come together , and wrote " ofumi ( gobunsho ) " explaining the teachings of shinran in plain words and disseminated it widely to the public .
by his achievement , hongan-ji temple rapidly developed and expanded , and came to be called ikko shu . ( on the contrary , other sects of shinshu went into decline . )
the strength of the group of followers in this kou was directed at politicians ( such as daimyo ) , despite rennyo 's restraint .
kokujin ( village heads ) and dogo ( powerful families ) converted to shinshu and joined the village people who were discontent with the system with complicated and multiple lordship in the end of the middle ages , and uprising called " ikko-ikki " were staged throughout the nation by united ikko shu followers from the whole county or province .
this led to frequent rebellions against daimyo throughout the nation , such as the one in kaga described below , and numbers of daimyo , including ieyasu tokugawa and kenshin uesugi , issued the anti-ikkoshu edicts ( kinkyorei ) .
the shimazu clan in satsuma province particularly continued the kinkyorei until the meiji period , which made shinshu followers organize kou and observe their faith secretly in a cave in the mountains . ( kakure nenbutsu / secret faith )
later , when the onin war ( 1467-1477 ) broke out and an internal conflict occurred between east and west squads in kaga province , north of yoshizaki gobo , as the base of hongan-ji temple at that time in echizen province , the monto of senshu-ji school took the side of kochiyo togashi who took part in the west squad , while the monto of honganji school , through the assistance of takakage asakura , the daimyo of echizen ( the 7th chief ) , took the side of masachika togashi , kochiyo 's brother and a former shugo deported from kaga , who belonged to east squad , and deported kochiyo in 1474 . ( in other words , ikko-ikki in kaga was started as a power struggle inside shinshu )
however , hongan-ji 's monto and masachika togashi opposed each other after that , and when masachika sent a force to subdue ikko shu in 1488 , they forced masachika to commit suicide by his sword , and achieved autonomous control ( however , masataka togashi of the togashi clan showed sympathy for ikko-ikki , and he remained shugo daimyo symbolically ) .
after that , the monto aimed to recapture the meeting house ( dojo ) in yoshizaki of which the asakura clan had deprived , and monto mustered from all over hokuriku area fought against the asakura clan more than once .
meanwhile , in kinai , the headquarters were yamashina hongan-ji temple , which rennyo , moving from yoshizaki , had built in kyoto in 1482 , and harumoto hosokawa , being afraid of its influence , set fire to yamashina hongan-ji temple in august in 1532 in conspiracy with nichiren shu followers ( shinshu calls this " tenbun no sakuran , " and nichiren shu " tenbun hokke no ran " ) .
hongan-ji temple lost their headquarters by this incident , and moved it to a temple in ishiyama in osaka , which rennyo had built in his final years ( 1496 ) , and lived in ( ishiyama hongan-ji temple ) .
since then , osaka developed around the monastery of hongan-ji temple , comparable to a castle , and a temple town formed around it , and it strength frightened power people of the time .
in 1568 , when nobunaga oda conquered kinai and came into conflict with yoshiaki ashikaga who became the seii taishogun , kennyo ( 1543-1592 ) , the 11th head-priest of hongan-ji temple , took the side of yoshiaki ashikaga , and on september 12 , 1570 , suddenly attacked the camp of nobunaga , who was attacking the miyoshi clan .
responding to this , monto rose in revolt around the nation , and the uprising by gansho-ji temple in nagashima in ise province ( nagashima ikko-ikki ) brought down kokie castle in owari province .
although kennyo and nobunaga concluded agreements a few times after that , kennyo , upon request from yoshiaki and others , violated the agreements several times , which caused most ikko-ikki other than ishiyama , such as nagashima or echizen , to be ended by mass executions by nobunaga .
in 1580 , after they had fought for as long as 10 years in ishiyama since the war broke out , nobunaga accepted the agreement proposed by emperor ogimachi , and disarmament of hongan-ji temple and kennyo 's departure from ishiyama brought the ishiyama hongan-ji war to an end .
( later , hideyoshi toyotomi constructed osaka castle in the area including the site of ishiyama hongan-ji temple . )
as described above , ikko-ikki was one of the biggest forces in japanese society at the time and ranked with sengoku daimyo ( warlords ) , but all the monto of shinshu did not go along with this movement .
as seen in the case of the battle between hongan-ji monto and senshu-ji school monto ( takada monto and shinshu sanmonto school ) in echizen province , some shinshu sects other than hongan-ji had a conflicting movement .
reconstruction in kyoto
in the days of hideyoshi toyotomi , in 1591 , kennyo was given land in the center of kyoto ( shichijo-horikawa , kyoto city ) and reconstructed hongan-ji temple .
in 1602 , mainly due to the confrontation in the sect over the difference of views when leaving ishiyama , and the influence of ieyasu tokugawa 's policy on religion , kyonyo ( 1558-161 ) , kennyo 's oldest son , was given the nearby land to the east of hongan-ji temple ( shichijo-karasuma , kyoto city ) by ieyasu , and built higashi hongan-ji temple .
by this incident , hongan-ji temple , which had the biggest religious influence at the time , was split into west ( current jodo shinshu hongan-ji school , shinshu kosho school , etc . ) with junnyo ( 1577-1630 ) , kennyo 's third son , as the 12th head-priest , and east ( current shinshu otani school , etc . ) with kyonyo , the oldest son , as the 12th head-priest .
when religions were restructured after the meiji restoration , and on the occasion of official registration as a religious association to daikyoin , only the current jodo shinshu hongan-ji school applied as jodo shinshu and others as shinshu , which has affected the current names .
furthermore , there exists a new religion related to jodo shinshu , which is connected to folk beliefs over a long period of history .
currently , it is made up of 10 schools affiliated to jodo shinshu sects and other schools , and as a whole sect , it has the most temples ( about 22,000 temples ) and followers among japanese buddhist sects .
shinshu jippa ( shinshu kyodan rengo )
shinshu kyodan rengo was organized as an association of shinshu sects to promote cooperation and coordination among the sects in 1923 , the 750th anniversary of shinran sho 'nin 's birth and the 700th anniversary of foundation of the religion .
